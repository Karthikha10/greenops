Rule-based resource optimization detection.

These checks deliberately do NOT use machine learning. They are simple,
explainable thresholds -- exactly the kind of logic a real operator could
verify by hand. This is what makes "idle server detection" and "storage
optimization insights" available from day one, without waiting on a trained
